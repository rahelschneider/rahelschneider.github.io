                            This page showcases the development of a remote tourism experience by me, Rahel
                            Schneider, and my team members Hideki Kama, Noriko Asada, and Keita Shigeno. We followed the
                            Double Diamond design thinking process to build a prototype of a remote tourist experience.

                            The starting point of our user research was marked by receiving Cultural Probes. In our
                            case, every team member prepared the Cultural Probes on their own before the first meeting.
                            As we designed for our own needs and the Cultural Probes were provided by a third party, the
                            method is thoroughly reasonable for gathering user data.

                            To structure and analyze the collected data we used Affinity Diagramming.

                            After finishing the analysis of our user data, we formulated an actionable problem
                            statement:
                        <h1>“Taro, a young man who lives in Japan and has never been abroad...needs a way to get in
                            touch with people in other countries and learn about their cultures...because...he grew up
                            on the island of Japan and wants to learn about other countries and cultures and make
                            friends all over the world so he can visit them when he has enough money.”</h1>
                        </p>
                        <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                            To create ideas that could solve our problem we used three different methods.
                        </p>
                        <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                            Before we designed the actual prototype, we created a wireframe and answered some open
                            questions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                            For our prototype, we decided to prepare static images with overlayed GUI controls. As we
                            had german and japanese students in our group, we created one German experience and one
                            Japanese experience.
                        </p>
                        <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                            We tested our prototype with 3 participants. We conducted the prototype tests via Zoom and
                            followed the Wizard of Oz principle.
                        </p>
                        <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                            During the prototype tests, it turned out that the users wanted to be able to enter
                            buildings. This is the reason for the additional screens in our final prototype. Users who
                            enabled direct translation sometimes started to speak English again, without disabling
                            direct translation. We suspect that this was due to a lack of visibility of system status.
                            Consequently, we added a central banner in the upper half of each frame that indicates
                            currently translated languages. Additionally, we observed that users do not see and
                            understand all provided controls. Our solution to this problem is a short introduction of
                            all controls at the start of each VR trip. The last alteration we made to the prototype was
                            adding more people to choose from. Mainly because users were confused by not having a
                            choice. For the remaining questions, we got validating answers from our user tests.
                            Additionally, there were no signs of the need for scripted conversations and most
                            importantly, all users wanted to be friends with the person they visited.
